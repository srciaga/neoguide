        <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> is a social network of
        websites that brings back the lost individual creativity of the web. It
        offers free static web hosting and tools to create and share your own
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide is for anyone with little to no HTML/CSS knowledge who wants
        to build their first site!
      </p>

      <h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
      <p>
        Before creating your website, plan it out. What pages do you want? An
        about page? A gallery? What do you want your website to look like? There
        are no rules—it’s up to you. The only limit is your coding ability and
        the resources you can find.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by
        <a href="https://neocities.org/browse">browsing Neocities</a> or other
        websites. See what you like and don’t like. Some people have a page
        dedicated to how they built their site, so look out for those.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write down anything that comes to mind. Make a simple mockup of what you
        want. Make a Pinterest board with inspiration—anything that’ll help you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a plan, look for resources to help you create your
        website. You can use your browser’s web developer tools to inspect
        elements and view source code.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some resources I’ve found:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/webmastery/"
            >sadgrl’s webmastery links</a
          >
          - HTML and CSS help, pre-made layouts, a layout builder, tiled
          backgrounds, etc.

      <h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
      <p>
        You need to learn HTML and CSS to build your site. If you want to add
        interactivity, learn JavaScript. Finding code snippets online is
        helpful, but understanding HTML/CSS basics goes a long way.
      </p>
      <h3 id="editor">Editor</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is a
        popular editor with many helpful extensions. Although many editors are
        available, I recommend this one. For a simple Neocities site, you could
        write your code in Notepad, but VSCode offers many helpful features.
        Check out
        <a href="https://youtu.be/EUJlVYggR1Y?si=LoeVbRudnkp9PfEC"
          >this video</a
        >
        to get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        To customize VSCode, look for themes
        <a href="https://vscodethemes.com/?language=html">here</a>. Click on a
        theme you like, then click the VS Code button to apply it. You can also
        preview it in your browser.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some plugins I recommend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode"
            >Prettier</a
          >
          - Formats your code, with an option to format on save.
        </li>

            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer"
            >Live Server</a
          >
          - Updates the browser preview every time you save.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag"
            >Auto Rename Tag</a
          >
          - Automatically renames paired tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css"
            >HTML CSS Support</a
          >
          - Provides CSS support for HTML files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag"
            >Auto Close Tag</a
          >
          - Automatically adds closing tags for HTML.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker"
            >Code Spell Checker</a
          >
          - Checks your code for spelling errors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Before coding, plan your content and layout. Write your HTML first, then
        style it with CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow a tutorial in a format that works best for you, whether written
        or video. Make sure you actively code along with the tutorial—watching
        alone isn’t enough. There are tutorials mentioned in the
        <a href="#planning">planning section</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to memorize every HTML tag or CSS property. Learn enough
        to bring your ideas to life on the webpage. If you have an idea but
        aren’t sure how to implement it, look it up! Don’t get discouraged—there
        are plenty of resources online, and you can always ask for help.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2 id="uploading-to-neocities">Uploading to Neocities</h2>
      <p>
        Once your site is done, upload it to Neocities. Click the upload button
        to select your files or drag and drop them (faster).
      </p>
      <div class="card warn">
        <section id="warning" class="text-uppercase">
          <h4>Warning!</h4>
        </section>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not upload multiple folders at once.</li>
          <li>
            If a file has the same name as an existing file in that folder, the
            old file will be overwritten.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Every time you want to update a page, just drag and drop it to replace
        the old file. If you’re adding a new page, remember to link to it so
        people can access it.
      </p>
      <p>Remember to have fun!!</p>
